Nodemailer with gmail 

gmail requires an APP Password when working with SMPT. Applications / services that have you log in using your user name and password are called "Less Secure Apps" and are no longer supported by google at least not since . 

Gmail is not the best service for production. I will need to change the SMPT service out with something more scalable next month. 
See this articile for more information: https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail

```
//With OAuth, uses a token that gets refreshed by nodemailer...but how...but when? 

  auth: {
    type: "OAuth2",
    user: "me@gmail.com",
    clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    refreshToken: process.env.GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN,
  },
```

```
//With less secure auth, just uses user name and password 

   auth: {
      user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
      pass: process.env.SMTP_PASSWORD,
    },
```
