## 🛠 What I Worked On

Working on building an interior design tool using an SVG canvas to display and manipulate graphics. Yesterday I was able to add icons to the project and learned more about "foreign objects" in vue which make it easy to render icons. 
Today I am working on fleshing out the structure of the app since I have a solid understadnign of how to work with the canvas. 

Features I would like to see are: 
  - Icons for common furniture pieces like beds, lamps, book shelfs, etc. 
  - Providing the user with the ability to select and resize elements using their cursor or specific values. 
  - Providing a default placement for elements using a button in the toolbar. For example, say I wanted to start with a basic bedroom layout. The icons could be placed already so the user does not have to add a bed, night stand, and other furniture pieces. 

In the future I'll create accounts and save designs but really I am trying to get a deeper understanding of how to work with state in Nuxt and how ref, useState, and reactive are applied in practice
I also want to see how to get common design features to work like resizing and snap to fit.

## 📝 Notes / Reflections/ Outstanding Questions

Speed up development and set up. 
- How to get started with Nuxt https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/installation
- Use Nuxt Component Library to create the layour of the project. I need to rely on component libraries in the future. DO NOT BUILD FROM SCRATCH.
