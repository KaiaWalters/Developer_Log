learned how to create an image and container in docker 

I learned how to detect which path is being used to execute docker commands using the terminal. There is a diference between globally installed docker via npm install -g docker and downloading docker desktop to access the docker commmand. 

terminal commands are connected to paths that are excuted via the terminal for example "docker" is connected to a script which caused issues and confusions when I first ran docker compose watch. To investigate i used 

type docker 
which -a docker
