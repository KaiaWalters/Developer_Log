# 🗓️ Developer Log – Week of 2025-09-15

## 🛠 What I Worked On
- AI learning platform 

## 📚 What I Learned

- I learned how to use cursor

## ✅ What Went Well

- I was able to complete the project

## 🚧 What Blocked Me
- Moving too quickly is blocking my learning. I was able to complete the project and was impressed by what cursor was able to develop, but I feel like I missed out on digging into the code and improving on it because I was in a rush to finish the assignment. 

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Review the application and how it has been constructed. I understand how it works, but want to be sure I am fully aware of where it needs to be improved and how I can build on what is there. I want to continue working on the backend so that I can add an email service to the project. That way a user can invite collaborators to help them imprve their leanring plan.
