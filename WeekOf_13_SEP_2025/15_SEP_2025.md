## ✅ What Went Well
- I was able to solve the two neet code problems

## 🚧 What Blocked Me
- N/A 

## 🔜 Next Steps

## 📝 Notes / Reflections
- I want to make sure that I carve out enough time to explore new ways of solving these problems. I have experience with two sum and anangram like problems. I want to do a better job of applying data structures when working on these going forward.
