# 🗓️ Developer Log – Week of 2025-09-13

## 🛠 What I Worked On
- Neetcode TwoSum
- began working on the first feature of my learningcompass application
## 📚 What I Learned
- I leanred that using a map object can improve the time complexity of the two sum solution. I usually resort to nested loops to solve these problems.Using a map makes it easier to determine if the target sum can be reached. 

- I learned how to create a PRD to cover a specific feature and to guide code genration in Cursor
- I learned how to debug code genrated bu cursor specifically react router. 

## ✅ What Went Well
- I was able to spend time on one neetcode. 
- Using the PRD actually improved Cursor's accuracy and made it easier for me to break down and refine my ideas for the app. 

## 🚧 What Blocked Me
- N/A 

## 🔜 Next Steps
- generating a leanring plan and setting up an export feature. I do not have the time to create individual user accounts, so I want this learning plan generator to be responsible for creating a plan for a user and allowing them to download it or push it to a reposiory in github to keep and maintain themselves. 


## 📝 Notes / Reflections
- I want to try to do my planning for my study sessions eaither the day before or during my lunch break. I am pretty good at getting straight to work omce I get home, but I am not always clear on waht I want to have done by 11pm I went over time which is not sustainable and did not leave enough time for me to work on the developer log that day so I had to do it after the fact.
