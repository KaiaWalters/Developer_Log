# 🗓️ Developer Log – Week of 2025-09-23

## 🛠 What I Worked On
- Neetcode Two Integer Sum II
- Neetcode Valid Palindrome
- Neetcode Container with Most Water
- Did research into OOTB data visualization tools, I am interested in using Material UI 
- Coworked on coding videos with "The coolest person to ever exist" (Stacy)

## 📚 What I Learned
- I revisited pointers and was happy to see that I remembered how to apply this algorithmn. I am getting more confident solving pointer problems. I am relying less on loops to traverse and array and compare values. 

## ✅ What Went Well
- Working on a neetcodes in the morning during breakfast is managable. I found that I can also plan out how i will solve a problem and test it on paper during lunch, then enter my code into the neetcode editor to test it. That worked well today. 

## 🚧 What Blocked Me
- My schedule changed at work so I will be getting back to base later. I was able to work on the dev log and neetcode using my hot spot so I did unblock myself slightly. 

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Work on debugging my code for the data visualization feature tomorrow morning or evening

## 📝 Notes / Reflections
- I want to spend some time exploring how I can make progress during the day. Because of PRDs a majority of my labor can go into clarifying what tools and technologies to use for my features. If I write these ideas down, then my evnings when I get time to be at my computer can be spent doing rather than ideating.
