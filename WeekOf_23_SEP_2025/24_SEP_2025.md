# 🗓️ Developer Log – Week of 2025-09-13

## 🛠 What I Worked On
- Neetcode Three Sum (pseudo code)
- Creating a PRD and refining requirements for the analytics page
- Creating a first draft of the page to be pushed to a branch off of main

## 📚 What I Learned
- I learned that using two pointers is great, but trying to work with 3 pointers in unessary. It is possible to define a thrid pointer by  finding the mid point between the two pointers. I learned that functions can be defined within interfaces. I learned how to expedite my design process using cursor without sacrificing design work. I am learning how to design interfaces during the day and think deeply about how to translate these design requirments into detailed PRDS. This is helping me to focus more on how to improve features and make my code more maintanable and modular. 

## ✅ What Went Well
- Working on pseudo code during the day and testing my code at night
- Ideating during the day and planning how I will be designing features. This did indeed help me develop faster at night. 

## 🚧 What Blocked Me
- Not creating enough time for deep work during the week. I need to try to separate deep work tasks from tasks that require less than an hour of concentration. I'll need to make sure that I take time on Saturday morning to go through the code that was generated by Claude and Cursor. This will help me to learn the patterns that the AIs are using to accomplish tasks. I also want to improve the design of the analytics page on Saturday and ensure that it is intuitive. 

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Work on debugging my code for the data visualization feature and get feedback from my team tomorrow morning. 

## 📝 Notes / Reflections
- I want to spend some time exploring how I can make progress during the day and how I can make more time for deep work during the week. During the weekends I can do that, but I want to be able to code every day and internalize this information over time, not just cram on Saturdays.
