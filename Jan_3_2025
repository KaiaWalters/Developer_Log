# 🗓️ Developer Log December 31st

## 🛠 What I Worked On

- Rebranding Project Mask Maker to instead be an interior design tool. An application for creating digital models of a space to make moving easier. TBD. 

## 📚 What I Learned

### NUXT - Dev Tools

- Nuxt devtools, getting started: https://devtools.nuxt.com/guide/getting-started
- Devtools are automatically installed when you set ```  devtools: { enabled: true }, ``` in nuxt.config.ts. To use the dev tools on mac press "Shift", "Option", and "D"

### SVGs and Canvas
- Error with displaying icons in the canvas. Managing how SVGs are displayed using fmoreign object tag. I don't fully understand this fix yet. I need a deeper understandign of how SVG canvases work. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/foreignObject
- SVG files don't always render correctly with <image> in SVG — browser compatibility can be inconsistent. I want to understand why though. I am not sure what the pattern is here

## 📝 Notes / Reflections/ Outstanding Questions

Speed up development and set up. 
- How to get started with Nuxt https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/installation
- Use Nuxt Component Library to create the layour of the project. I need to rely on component libraries in the future. DO NOT BUILD FROM SCRATCH.
