# 🗓️ Developer Log December 31st

## 🛠 What I Worked On

- Project Mask Maker. An application for designing masks using Vue, Nuxt, and some kind of canvas. TBD. 

## 📚 What I Learned

### NUXT - Building
- Nuxt Component Library 
- Nuxt is Next for Vue applications and employs the similar concepts / strategies for making routing and compiling faster 
- How to get started with Nuxt https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/installation

#### Global Components
```  
    //PAGE.VUE
      <template #left>
        <NuxtLink to="/">
          <AppLogo class="w-auto h-6 shrink-0" />
        </NuxtLink>
        <TemplateMenu />
      </template>

   //In Nuxt, global components are Vue components that Nuxt quietly registers for you so they’re available everywhere in your app without imports.
   //Global components are best for foundational UI, not one-off widgets. BaseButton, BaseInput, BaseCard , AppHeader, AppFooter, UiModal, UiTooltip
   // Important to know that Vue does not export or import functional components like react. The file name is used to identify/reference the component globally. 


  //NUXT/types/components.d.ts/ => GlobalComponents 

    interface _GlobalComponents {
      'AppLogo': typeof import("../../app/components/AppLogo.vue").default
    } 

  //Nuxt automatically scans your components/ folder and registers everything it finds.
```

#### State Management 

- Nuxt provides state management libraries and the useState composable to create a reactive and SSR-friendly shared state.
- ```ref ``` has been replaced by ```useState``` in Nuxt. Why? 
- Pinia is the preferred state management library for Nuxt, https://nuxt.com/modules/pinia
- How does serialization affect useState in Next

How does Nuxt Server work? 

### NUXT - CI/CD

##### Pre-push checks (just let the editor do it, forget the fuss) 
- Linting , ESLint
- Testing, Jest or Vitest (preferred by docs) 


### Cursor
- Shell commands for Cursor

## 📝 Notes / Reflections/ Outstanding Questions

Speed up development and set up. 
- How to get started with Nuxt https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/installation
- Use Nuxt Component Library to create the layour of the project. I need to rely on component libraries in the future. DO NOT BUILD FROM SCRATCH.
