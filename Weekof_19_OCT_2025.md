## 🛠 What I Worked On
- Setting up my portfolio project with docker and a AI generated git activity summary 
- Reading the papers and watching the videos that were assigned, learn more about LLMs 
- Linked list leetcodes 
- Containerizing my developer portfolio 

## 📚 What I Learned
**Manipulating LinkedList**
- Reassigning the value of head in order to traverse a linkedlist 
- The purpose of a dummyHead is to create a starting point for a new list. dummyHead.next will return the resulting new list. 
- Visualizing a linkedList as a chain of LinkNodes is the best way for me to work through problems
- Spliting a linked list using pointers ``` let fast = head.next; let slow = head.next.next ```
- Using recursion to traverse linkedlist ```  ```

## ✅ What Went Well
- When I don't fully grasp what is happening in a neet code solution I am now breaking down the key skills that are needed in order to solve the problem and am documenting them. Thsi whay I can practice these micro skills during the week. I need to come up with a way to visualize each object so it is easier for me to think through problems.
